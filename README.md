# Description

This tool facilitates the use of MMD models in Unity, as well as custom Shaders for this purpose.
The Shaders were created based on studies in the 'MMD4Mecanim' package, and were recreated and improved in two tools: 'Shader Graph' and 'Amplify Shader Editor' due to the capabilities and applications of each resource.
It also has Scripts that shape the Unity interface to make it similar to the MMD tools and make it more practical and faster to use. In addition to other things that allow you to speed up development.
